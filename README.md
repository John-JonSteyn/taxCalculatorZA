<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## How to use the Tax Calculator

When you run the script, this message will be displayed. From here we just follow the instructions:

- Enter your age.
- Enter 'A' if you receive an Annual Salary
- Enter 'M' if you reveive a Monthly Salary
- Enter the amount you earn before tax.

Voila!
